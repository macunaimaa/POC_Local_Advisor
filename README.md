# POC_Local_Advisor
Self-hosted AI advisor designed to operate without user prompts.

The system observes available context such as to-do lists, activity signals, and optional video or action streams, and proactively suggests improvements, alternatives, or next steps. Rather than responding to explicit queries, it functions as a background advisor that offers timely hints and ideas when they are likely to be useful.

This repository is a proof of concept, with an initial focus on creative writing support: suggesting narrative directions, stylistic changes, and conceptual refinements based on ongoing work. The long-term goal is a standalone, privacy-preserving assistant that augments human decision-making through contextual awareness rather than direct instruction.

This work is inspired by emerging research on the cognitive effects of constant reliance on large language models. Recent studies suggest that while LLMs can make work faster, they may also reduce work quality over time by weakening users’ ability to think, explore ideas, and formulate effective prompts. This creates a broader problem for widespread AI adoption: efficiency increases, but creative and cognitive skills can degrade for most users.

This project is designed for people who are interested in a form of agentic minimalism, gaining the benefits of AI assistance without outsourcing thinking itself. The goal is to preserve ideation, independent reasoning, and creative flow, while still achieving meaningful performance gains from AI tools. Ideally, the system supports focus and helps users reach flow states more easily, rather than interrupting or replacing thought processes.

Although this project intentionally limits the role and autonomy of AI agents, AI tools are still used in the development of this proof of concept.
